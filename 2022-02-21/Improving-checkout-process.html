  <h2 id="about-the-project">About the project</h2>

<p>Crowdservice is an auction-based job-search mobile app. It enables users post jobs or place bids to win one.</p>

<h2 id="my-role">My role</h2>

<p>I’ve worked with Crowdservice as a UX/UI designer. I helped improve usability of checkout process and redesigned existing navigation to make it intuitive and easy-to-use.</p>

<p>Besides that, I helped to redesign the look and feel of the app.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/crowdservice_screens.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<h2 id="challenge">Challenge</h2>

<p>The app had a number of usability issues that cause users to switch to competitors.</p>

<p>The key functionality like checkout and bidding process were not user friendly. Based on the research data, people mostly give up on those stages.</p>

<h2 id="process">Process</h2>

<p>I’ve started my process with gathering information about the product goals, its users, their pain points and needs. Stepping into the users shoes and using the product by myself, helped me identify usability issues.</p>

<p>In between, I conducted market analysis in order to understand what other projects like ours offers to their customers.</p>

<p>With all needed insights, I rolled my sleeve and started mapping out user flows and sketching ideas with improvements.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/app_flows.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>The app has around 7 possible ways to complete a job.
This part was the most challenging during working on the project. I had to identify and note down the possible pain points that people could face during the process.</p>

<h2 id="issues-i-identified">Issues I identified</h2>

<h3 id="bids-and-active-jobs">Bids and active jobs.</h3>

<p>Problem:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Complex informational structure;</li>
  <li>Multiple levels of information;</li>
  <li>Visually hard to differentiate job states.</li>
</ul>

<p>Solution:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Added segmented controls;</li>
  <li>Grouped content;</li>
  <li>Created visual identity of different states.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/images/problem_1.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<h3 id="placing-a-bid">Placing a bid.</h3>

<p>Problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Information about fee was hidden from a bidder.</li>
</ul>

<p>Solution:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Added details about fees and earning amount.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="/assets/images/problem_2.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<h3 id="job-info-after-placing-a-bid">Job info after placing a bid.</h3>

<p>Problem:</p>

<ul>
  <li>No clue that the bid has been placed.</li>
</ul>

<p>Solution:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Reminder shows amount of a previously placed bid;</li>
  <li>Added expiry date timer;</li>
  <li>Highlighted day and time of the job;</li>
  <li>Text of the button changes to “Bid again”.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="validation">Validation</h2>

<p>It was time to validate assumptions and test the redesigned checkout. With the help of the client, I manage to plan a total of 5 online user testing sessions: 3 with people who want to find someone help with their daily choir, and 2 with people who want to perform these kind of jobs. As a reward we offered an Amazon gift card.</p>

<p>It took me around a week and a half to prepare a script and clickable prototype. My client helped organise and schedule calls with our users.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/prototype.png" alt="alt text" /></p>

<p>The testing helped me spot new insights like:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The info about the bid fee was not clear to people;</li>
  <li>Labels of statuses were confusing;</li>
  <li>The cancelation of a job still was confusing.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="results">Results</h2>

<p>10% increase in user engagement within 3 weeks of launch.</p>
